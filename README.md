# GameHaeDuo Verification Program
A program that verifies Gamehaeduo's **Matching Algorithm**.

## About GameHaeDuo Verification Program
* We crawl data from [op.gg](https://www.op.gg/). This website has real-time stats for League of Legend.
* We crawl real-time data and use that data to find how duos are playing League of Legend. We use the crawled data to compare it with our original program. Comparing the data is also included in the verification program. 
* Our original project is [here](https://github.com/CAU-OSS-2019/team-project-team17). 

### Necessity
* Verification program is needed to show that our project is working correctly.  
* However, since there are not many users at present, it is difficult to prove the accuracy of the matching algorithm through the actual users of Gamehaeduo.  
* Therefore, we made our very own verification program.


### Support Websites
* [op.gg](https://www.op.gg/)  
* [leagueofgraphs](https://www.leagueofgraphs.com/ko/champions/counters)  


## Getting Started with GameHaeDuo Verification
* You will need Python to run our program. 
* Once you run the program the program will require the number of users you want to crawl. 
* The more data the more accurate the verifying process will be.
